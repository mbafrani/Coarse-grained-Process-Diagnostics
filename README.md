# diagnostic-framework
- To run the application, Python is required.
- Run app.py using Python and use the 127.0.0.1:5000 as the homepage URL in the browser.
- The sample event logs and coarse-grained process logs (time series data sets) are provided under the Outputs folder.
- By opening the http://127.0.0.1:5000, the tabs are ordered to correctly follow the steps from uploading an event log, generating time series data, and performing single and multiple aspect analysis.   
- The tool can be started with an event log or directly using the generated time series data sets for the aspect analysis and multiple aspect analysis tabs. Samples can be found under the Outputs folder.   
- All the event logs or the generated time series data for uploading to the tool should be under Outputs directory or root directory.  
- Results including data sets, figures, and analysis can also be found under Outputs.  
- Note that with small event logs, i.e., a limited number of events and cases, or large time window sizes, there might be an exception in some techniques due to the lack of data.
